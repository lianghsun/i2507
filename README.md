### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a coder who is interleaving with web, cyber issue, network and deep learning. Some technologies I interested in: Python, Tensorflow, PHP (particularly in Laravel), Penetration, ..etc, coding makes me a lot fun ðŸ¤©. Life is so amazing that I have a chance to learn deep learning and drug domain know-how, even I haven't heard them before! Recently, I focus more on how to apply deep learning on drug discovery ðŸ’Š with Tensorflow 2.x and analysis new generated compounds properties with RDKit.
